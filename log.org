** DONE Define double centering
** DONE Define MDS
** DONE Summarize
*** CCA based similarity can be misleading, and can depend on the
      activation function.
*** CCA based similarity will cluster based on architecture and
      activation, but the "fixed point topology" and linearized
      dynamics remains similar.
** DONE email them about typo on pg 8
** DONE Are these three tasks standard?
*** K bit flip flop uhh doesn't seem to be
*** sine wave lol... this also comes from some paper written
      earlier by one of the authors
*** CDI doesn't seem to be
** DONE How exactly do they construct this "fixed point topology
    MDS"?
    
    I see. It seems:
*** Construct a markov chain consisting of the fixed points for
      each model
*** Construct a connectivity matrix for the fixed point graph
*** Put all these matrices in the same space, by imposing some
      order on the set of fixed points
      
      Throw out all models which have a non-modal number of fixed
      points.
*** Use euclidean distance (I guess the frobenius norm) to
      quantify dissimilarity.
** DONE How is this constructed for sine wave generation?
    
    Hmm... they don't seem to mention this.
** DONE Add comments to the paper pdf file
** DONE Add into anki
comment
** I feel like their topology analysis is interesting, but sort of
    just confirms the obvious. Yes, all the models are trained on
    the same task, so of course they're learning the same things.
** It would be helpful if they released code. The following things
    are not made clear:
*** How they do fixed point topology MDS (slightly more clear on
      the flip flop task, but even there not exactly)
*** What they mean by eigvals (fig 3e) is the eigvals of some
      section of the jacobian matrix at a fixed point, right?

**** Interesting.. it seems that papers presenting a dataset go
       into a lot of detail about how the data was collected. It
       makes sense.
**** They talk about the "training of annotators". Isn't this kind
       of like training an organic neural network on a small amt of
       data, to then generate more data for another neural network to
       train on?
**** They talk about annotators having 3 or 4 months of
       experience.. wtf? How long were annotators working on this
       damn thing?

Consensus is that this is unnecessary. My email to Yonatan:

Well, maxmincorr is extracted from the correlation matrix, so it
contains strictly more information than just the index and correlation
of the most correlated neuron pair.

My point is that I don't think we should remove the line

            if network == other_network:
                continue

In MaxMinCorr. The reasoning is:
- If we did, I don't think it would tell us much. All the info we'd have
  would be pairs. The whole correlation matrix is strictly better.
- If we did and added the whole correlation matrix to the output for
  every pair, our output would be way too big, and most of it would be
  unused.
 
Thus, I feel like this would be better to add as a different method,
probably in a completely different script. Even semantically, the
=corr_methods.py= module is supposed to be comparing representations
across layers, not intra-layer representations. Also, intra-layer
representations will require completely different methods, because the
goal is no longer determining correlation.

You also mentioned doing this for LinReg. What exactly did you mean? I'm
not sure how to interpret regressing the rest of the layer onto a
particular neuron means. I feel like the interpretation would be the
opposite of the others---the higher the predictive power, the more
useless the neuron is, because it just means that it's direction can
already be expressed as a linear combination of others. This isn't
precise because the learning dynamics affects this, but again, I feel
like it has to be treated differently.

Also, it might screw up the neuron sorts.

I feel like many of these computations can be rewritten so they read
from files on disk, and operate on files on disk. I feel like this is
particularly true of simple statistics like mean, std, etc.

So, what should the format of such a file be?

{
    "mean": {model : means},
    "std" : {model : std},
    "max" : {model : max},
    "min" : {model : min},
}

Ahh, shit.

I don't think it's useful to put code for it in =corr_methods.py=. I
should just load the canonical correlations, and do everything directly.

There is also an interesting idea: could I get the heatmap to change, as
you change the value of k?

Well, for PWCCA, this is not as straightforward. It would require more
computation. Also, how would you even do it?

Ahh, shit. minlinreg failed. Actually, I don't think it failed.

waiting on jobid 5275, which is maxlinreg. OK, everything looks good.
- [X] Regen
  - [X] Make test sbatchable
  - [X] Wait on results
    
    Wait, so is the sbatch finished? Yep
  - [X] Regen first for the test
    
    We need to get the analysis nb working again. 
    - [X] Create a generic =update= function that works for both pw and
      sv.
    - [X] Create interactive heatmaps for maxmincorr and linregcorr
      - [X] Reindex to make rows = columns
  - [X] Copy test over, regen
    
    Waiting on notebook analysis-8 to finish
